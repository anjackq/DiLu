        {delimiter} Driving scenario description:
        You are driving on a road with 4 lanes, and you are currently driving in the second lane from the left. Your speed is 25.00 m/s, acceleration is 0.00 m/s^2, and lane position is 363.14 m. 
        There are other vehicles driving around you, and below is their basic information:
        - Vehicle `912` is driving on the same lane of you and is ahead of you. The speed of it is 23.30 m/s, acceleration is 0.00 m/s^2, and lane position is 382.33 m.
        - Vehicle `864` is driving on the lane to your right and is ahead of you. The speed of it is 21.30 m/s, acceleration is 0.00 m/s^2, and lane position is 373.74 m.
        - Vehicle `488` is driving on the lane to your left and is ahead of you. The speed of it is 23.61 $m/s$, acceleration is 0.00 $m/s^2$, and lane position is 368.75 $m$.

        {delimiter} Your available actions:
        IDLE - remain in the current lane with current speed Action_id: 1
        Turn-left - change lane to the left of the current lane Action_id: 0

        **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
        1. **Safety Check:** The vehicle directly ahead in my lane (Vehicle 912) is only 19.19 meters away (382.33m - 363.14m), which is under the 25m safety buffer. It is also traveling slower than me (23.30 m/s vs 25.00 m/s). This presents an immediate collision risk.
        2. **Efficiency Consideration:** My current speed is 25.00 m/s, which is close to the 28 m/s target, but safety supersedes efficiency. Accelerating or maintaining speed will cause a rear-end collision.
        3. **Lane Change Feasibility:** Changing lanes is not safe. The left lane is blocked by Vehicle 488 (only 5.61m ahead), and the right lane is blocked by Vehicle 864 (only 10.6m ahead). Both are too close to attempt a safe lane change.
        4. **Conclusion:** Since I cannot safely maintain speed, accelerate, or change lanes due to surrounding traffic, I must decelerate to avoid crashing into Vehicle 912.

        **Answer:**
        Reasoning: The lead car in my lane is critically close (under 25m) and slower, and adjacent lanes are blocked, mandating immediate deceleration.

        You are an autonomous driving decision module. You must strictly follow a Chain of Thought reasoning process before making a decision.

        ### DRIVE LOGIC:
        1. SAFETY: If a lead car is closer than 25m and your speed is higher, you MUST decelerate (Action_id 4).
        2. NO-UNNECESSARY-LANE-CHANGE: If the lead car in your current lane is not slower than you (or not close enough to block you), do not change lane just for preference.
        3. EFFICIENCY: Maintain a target speed of 28m/s.
        4. TRAFFIC RULE (RIGHT-HAND TRAFFIC): Prefer overtaking from the LEFT lane.
           - If blocked by slower traffic in your lane, first consider Turn-left (Action_id 0) when safe.
           - Do NOT choose Turn-right (Action_id 2) to overtake a slower vehicle in front unless there is a clear safety reason and left change is not feasible.
           - If no safe lane change exists and risk is increasing, decelerate (Action_id 4).
